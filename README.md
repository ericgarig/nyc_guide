nyc_guide
=========================

NYC guide is a hobby site that I have created for myself and my girlfriend. It keeps track of places we have been to ( or are planning on visitng in the near future ), and what we think about what makes great.

This project is something I work on in the spare time, and by no means done.

The project can currently be viewed at: http://ericgarig.pythonanywhere.com/
